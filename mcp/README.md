# ShardX MCP server

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets an AI client
(Claude Desktop, Cursor, …) drive the **ShardX Launcher**:

- the local automation **HTTP API** — create/edit/launch/close profiles,
  manage proxies, fingerprints, folders and cookies;
- a launched profile's **browser over CDP**, driven with
  [`patchright`](https://github.com/Kaliiiiiiiiii-Vinyzu/patchright-nodejs)
  (a stealth-patched Playwright) so the automation stays undetected.

Requires **Node ≥ 18**. The app itself does **not** run this server — it
only downloads the source for you (**Settings → MCP server → Download MCP
server**, pick a folder). You then install deps and register it with your
MCP client.

### 1. Install deps

`connectOverCDP` only *connects* to the already-running ShardX browser, so
patchright's own Chromium is never needed — install with the browser
download skipped to keep `node_modules` small:

```bash
cd <downloaded>/mcp
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 PATCHRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install
```

### 2. Register with your MCP client (stdio)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shardx": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/mcp/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "SHARDX_API": "http://127.0.0.1:40325",
        "SHARDX_TOKEN": "<Bearer token from Settings → Automation API>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP mode (optional, self-hosted)

If you'd rather host it yourself and connect by URL, run it with
`MCP_HTTP_PORT` set — it then serves at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp`:

```bash
MCP_HTTP_PORT=40326 SHARDX_API=http://127.0.0.1:40325 SHARDX_TOKEN=… node index.js
```

## Environment

| Var             | Default                  | Notes                                               |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `SHARDX_API`    | `http://127.0.0.1:40325` | Launcher API base URL.                              |
| `SHARDX_TOKEN`  | —                        | Bearer token (Settings). Required.                  |
| `MCP_HTTP_PORT` | — (stdio)                | When set, serve HTTP at `127.0.0.1:<port>/mcp`.     |

## Tools

**API**

- `list_profiles`, `get_profile`, `create_profile`, `create_temporary_profile`,
  `edit_profile`, `delete_profile`
- `new_fingerprint(platform?)`
- `refresh_rate` on `create_profile`, `create_temporary_profile` and
  `edit_profile` — how often the claimed display refreshes, in Hz. No web API
  reports it; a page measures it by timing `requestAnimationFrame`, so leaving
  it out is not neutral: the engine then claims 60, what most machines report,
  rather than the host's own screen.
- `start_profile(id, headless?)` → returns the CDP endpoint. The call waits up
  to 30s for it; if it still has none, `cdp` is null and `cdp_error` says why.
  `stop_profile(id)`, `list_running`
- `list_proxies`, `add_proxy`, `delete_proxy`
- `list_extensions`, `add_extension(url | path)`, `delete_extension` — a Web
  Store link or a bare extension id is enough; the launcher downloads the
  `.crx`. Pass the ids to `create_profile` / `edit_profile` as `extensions`.
- `list_bookmarks`, `save_bookmark(url, title?, folder?)`, `delete_bookmark` —
  bound to a folder they reach every profile in it on its next launch
- `list_trash`, `restore_profile(id)`, `purge_profile(id)` — `delete_profile`
  moves a profile here, restorable for 7 days
- `list_fingerprints`, `list_folders`, `rename_folder`, `delete_folder`
- `export_cookies`, `import_cookies`

**Automation projects** — the projects the launcher's Automation section
builds. A project drives its own browsers through the Motion domain, so these
work whether or not a profile is running:

- `list_automation_projects`, `get_automation_project(id)`,
  `create_automation_project(name?)`,
  `save_automation_project(id, project)` — whole-project replace, send back
  what `get` returned with `blocks` and `run` edited
- `duplicate_automation_project(id)`, `delete_automation_project(id)`
- `export_automation_project(id)` / `import_automation_project(bundle)` —
  export empties every parameter the project marked secret and lists them
  under `needs`
- `run_automation_project(id)`, `stop_automation_project(id)`,
  `automation_status(id)`, `list_automation_runs`
- `list_automation_modules`, `install_automation_module(path)`,
  `remove_automation_module(id)` — WebAssembly modules, each contributing
  blocks under the kind `module:<module id>:<block>`

**Browser (CDP via patchright)** — auto-starts the profile (CDP, optional
headless) if it isn't running; actions target the profile's *active* tab:

- Navigation: `browser_navigate(url, headless?)`, `browser_back`,
  `browser_forward`, `browser_reload`, `browser_current_url`
- Waiting: `browser_wait_for_selector(selector, state?, timeout_ms?)`,
  `browser_wait_for_load(state?)`, `browser_wait(ms)`,
  `browser_wait_for_url(url, timeout_ms?)`, `browser_wait_for_function(expression, timeout_ms?)`
- Read: `browser_content`, `browser_text`, `browser_get_html(selector?)`,
  `browser_get_text(selector)`, `browser_get_attribute(selector, name)`,
  `browser_exists(selector)`, `browser_count(selector)`,
  `browser_element_state(selector)`, `browser_bounding_box(selector)`,
  `browser_links`, `browser_evaluate(expression)`, `browser_get_cookies`
- Interact: `browser_click(selector)`, `browser_double_click(selector)`,
  `browser_right_click(selector)`, `browser_fill(selector, text)`,
  `browser_type(selector, text, delay_ms?)`, `browser_press(key)`,
  `browser_hover(selector)`, `browser_select_option(selector, value, by?)`,
  `browser_set_checkbox(selector, checked)`, `browser_focus(selector)`,
  `browser_drag(from, to)`, `browser_mouse_click(x, y)`,
  `browser_scroll(selector? | dx/dy)`, `browser_scroll_to_bottom`,
  `browser_set_files(selector, paths)`
- Human input (patched `Motion` domain — real pointer trajectories and
  key-by-key typing, produced inside the browser process):
  `human_click(selector | x,y)`, `human_move(selector | x,y)`,
  `human_fill(selector, text, clear?)`, `human_type(text)`,
  `human_release_pointer`
- Finger gestures (phone profiles only): `touch_tap(selector | x,y, tap_count?)`,
  `touch_long_press(selector | x,y, hold_ms?)`,
  `touch_swipe(selector | x,y, dx/dy | to_x/to_y, flick?)`,
  `touch_drag(selector | x,y, to_selector | to_x/to_y, hold_ms?)`,
  `touch_pinch(scale, selector | x,y, rotation?)`,
  `rotate_screen(angle, turn_ms?)`
- Capture: `browser_screenshot(full_page?)`,
  `browser_element_screenshot(selector)`, `browser_pdf` (headless),
  `browser_set_viewport(width, height)`
- Storage / network: `browser_set_cookies(cookies)`, `browser_clear_cookies`,
  `browser_local_storage(action, key?, value?)`,
  `browser_set_extra_headers(headers)`, `browser_dialog(action, prompt_text?)`,
  `browser_block_resources(types)`
- Tabs: `browser_list_tabs`, `browser_open_tab(url?)`,
  `browser_switch_tab(index)`, `browser_close_tab(index?)`
- Frames: `browser_frames`, `browser_frame_evaluate(frame, expression)`
- Scrape / a11y: `browser_get_texts(selector)`, `browser_input_value(selector)`,
  `browser_insert_text(text)`, `browser_aria_snapshot(selector?)`
- Network: `browser_wait_for_response(url_pattern, timeout_ms?)`,
  `browser_capture_start` / `browser_capture_stop` (request log),
  `browser_mock(url_pattern, status?, body?, content_type?)` / `browser_unmock(url_pattern?)`,
  `browser_intercept(url_pattern, headers?, post_data?, abort?)` (modify in flight),
  `browser_set_network_conditions(offline?, latency_ms?, download_kbps?, upload_kbps?)`
- Keyboard: `browser_press_on(selector, key)`
- Downloads: `browser_wait_for_download(dir, timeout_ms?)`

(All take `profile_id` as the first argument.)

## Typical agent flow

1. `create_profile` (or `create_temporary_profile`) — optionally with a `proxy`.
2. `browser_navigate(profile_id, "https://…")` — starts the browser with
   CDP and opens the page.
3. `browser_evaluate` / `browser_screenshot` / `browser_click` / `browser_fill`.

### Human input

`browser_click` and `browser_fill` go through Playwright: instant, and
they look it. The `human_*` tools go through the patched core's `Motion`
domain instead — the pointer travels a real trajectory whose duration
obeys Fitts's law, and text is typed key by key with log-normal gaps,
digraph-dependent timing and key overlap. Nothing is injected into the
page to do it.

They take the same selectors as everything else; the wrapper resolves the
element, scrolls it into view, and hands the core the coordinates and the
element's real width (which is what makes a small target take longer to
reach than a large one). Give `x` and `y` instead of a selector when you
already know where to go.

```
human_fill(profile_id, "#email", "ada@example.com")
human_fill(profile_id, "#email", "new@example.com", clear: true)
human_click(profile_id, "button[type=submit]")
```

`clear: true` selects the current value with a triple click rather than a
keyboard shortcut, so the clearing is as human as the typing. `human_type`
types into whatever has focus, for the cases where the focus is already
where you want it.

These calls take **real time** — `human_fill` returns when the last key is
up, and reports how long the move and the typing took. Budget for it the
way you would for a person.

### Phones

A profile that claims a touchscreen has no cursor, and the core enforces
that: it refuses `Motion.tap` and every other pointer command on one, and
refuses the finger commands everywhere else. A phone that moves a cursor
and hovers has contradicted itself before any check on the motion begins.

You do not have to keep track of which you have. `human_click` becomes a
tap on a phone profile — a long press when you asked for the right button,
because that is the phone's context menu — and `human_fill` taps the field
before typing. `human_move` is the one that refuses: hovering has no touch
equivalent, and a tap in its place would be a different thing that looked
like success.

The `touch_*` tools are the gestures a cursor cannot make at all:

```
touch_swipe(profile_id, dy: -400)                  # scroll the page
touch_swipe(profile_id, dy: -400, flick: true)     # ... and fling it
touch_long_press(profile_id, ".card")              # context menu
touch_drag(profile_id, ".card", to_selector: ".column-2")
touch_pinch(profile_id, scale: 2)                  # zoom in
rotate_screen(profile_id, angle: 90)
```

Each one places its own contacts, plays the whole gesture and lifts them.
There is no touchScroll and no fling command on purpose: gestures are made
in the browser out of the touch stream, so a real swipe produces the
scroll and the fling with the velocity the browser's own tracker fitted.

`touch_drag` differs from `touch_swipe` in one way that decides everything:
the contact stays still until the browser's long-press timers have fired,
which is when a page's drag-and-drop starts. A stroke that begins earlier
is a scroll.

`rotate_screen` is physical and takes time. The pose the sensors report
starts moving first and the screen angle commits at the end, which is the
order a handset produces. It answers once the new angle has reached the
page, so `screen.width` read straight after is already the turned one.
4. `stop_profile` when done (temporary profiles self-delete on close).
